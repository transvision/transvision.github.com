		<p>2012, and the last group of students to have their degree show in Ashburne House. This is certainly an occasion to remember, and this group of photography graduates-to-be have risen to the challenge. As I write this brief introduction to the catalogue, the final prints are being prepared, selected, spotted and worried over, the potential title and texts are being written and re-written, and the different possibilities of presentation, to frame or not to frame, are being considered, rejected and re-considered.</p>
		<p>Finally the class of 2012 has stopped asking how to improve their grade, or what we, the staff, want them to do, instead each one of them is wrapped up in their own exquisite bubble, perfecting their work because it has become all-absorbing to them. In each case the stress of aiming for perfection, of trying to keep control whilst taking on  new challenges, of having to make decisions without knowing for certain what the outcome will be, creates an atmosphere which can be felt by all; an excitement, a creative energy charged with the sound of time slowly running out.</p>
		<p>This degree show in 2012 is special as we recognise the need to say goodbye to Ashburne House, but it is also special because this group of students have raised the bar, risen to the occasion and created what I am confident will be an extraordinary exhibition.</p>
